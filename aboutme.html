            My name is Aarush Muthukrishnan and I am currently 12 years old. I have become beloved with coding since the age of 7. Ever since then, I have slowly taught myself with curiosity how to code and became my main hobby. I first started out with a simple program: Scratch. After that, I started to learn python, html, css, javascript, and some Azure Ai Fundamentals. Over these 5 years of coding, I learnt that anyone can code if they put in the time and effort into it.

            During school or other classes, I always wondered if there was an easy way to keep track of your work and not fall behind. This was my inspiration for ClassMate, which has the tools I need and think other people probably do to make there life easier. During class, taking notes and listening to the teacher wasn't an easy job. Well, ClassMate takes care of that, where you can just record the class audio and upload it to ClassMate, and it will give you all the key points and meeting minutes. A main issue students have is time manegment. ClassMate also takes care of that with a easy-to-acess to-do list so you can always stay organized.
